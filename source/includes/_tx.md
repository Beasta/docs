# Transactions API

BlockCypher's Transactions API allows you to look up information about unconfirmed transactions, query transactions based on hash, and create and propagate your own transactions, including multisignature transactions---all [based on the coin/chain resource](#restful-resources:-coins-&-chains) you've selected for your endpoints.

If you're new to blockchains, the idea of transactions is relatively self-explanatory. Here's what's going on underneath the hood: a transaction takes previous "unspent transaction outputs" (also known as [UTXOs](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output)) as "transaction inputs" and creates new "locking scripts" on those inputs such that they are "sent" to new addresses (to become new UTXOs). While most of these public addresses are reference points for single private keys that can "unlock" the newly created UTXOs, occasionally they are sent to more exotic addresses through *pay-to-script-hash*, typically multisignature addresses.

Generally speaking, UTXOs are generated from previous transactions (except for [Coinbase inputs](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/coinbase)).

Even if you don't use the API to assist in creating transactions, we highly recommend using BlockCypher to push your raw transactions. BlockCypher maintains connections to 20% of all nodes on all blockchains it supports, which means we can propagate transactions faster than almost anyone else. Given our speed and reliability, this is especially powerful when used in concert with our <a href="#zero-confirmation-confidence">Zero Confirmation Confidence factor.</a>

The Unconfirmed Transactions Endpoint returns an array of the latest transactions relayed by nodes in a blockchain that haven't been included in any blocks.

Resource | Method | Return Object
-------- | ------ | -------------
/txs | GET | Array[[Transactions](#transactions)]

The returned object is an array of [Transactions](#transactions) that haven't been included in blocks, arranged in reverse chronological order (latest is first, then older transactions follow).

<aside class="notice">
Due to <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/malleability">transaction malleability</a> it can be difficult to deal with transaction hashes before they've been confirmed in blocks. Use caution, and consider applying our <a href="#zero-confirmation-confidence">Zero Confirmation Confidence</a> factor to mitigate potential issues.

The Transaction Hash Endpoint returns detailed information about a given transaction based on its hash.


Resource | Method | Return Object
-------- | ------ | -------------
/txs/$TXHASH | GET | [Transactions](#transactions)

$TXHASH is a *string* representing the hex-encoded transaction hash you're interested in querying, for example:

`f854aebae95150b379cc1187d848d58225f3c4157fe992bcd166f58bd5063449`

The returned object contains detailed information about the transaction, including the value transfered, date received, and a full listing of inputs and outputs.
